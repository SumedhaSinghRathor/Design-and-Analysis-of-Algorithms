**1.1 Aim of the program:** Write a program to find out the second smallest and the second largest element stored in an array of n integers.  
&nbsp; _Input:_ Size of an array is 'n' and read 'n' number of elements from a disc file.
&nbsp; _Output:_ Second smallest, second largest
\\
**1.2 Aim of the program:** Given an array arr[] of size N, find the prefix sum of the array. A prefix sum array is another array prefixSum[] of the same size, such that the value of prefixSum[i] is arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2] . . . arr[i].
